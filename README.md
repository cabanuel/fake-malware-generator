# fake-malware-generator
A GoLang program that intakes common strings and IOCs from YARA rules to generate binaries that contain those strings and/or attempt to emulate that behavior in a safe manner

## lockbit
Go module specifically meant to emulate Lockbit in Windows based on the YARA rules found in the detection-rules directory. A proof of concept.

**Currently 8 Vendors on Virus Total identify this as malicious.**

## gosrc
Contains all the golang used. Currently things are hardcoded for testing and attempting to emulate Lockbit. `fakemal_generator.go` is the main harness for the fake malware

## python-scripts
Some in-development parsers for yara and yaml

## detection-rules
Some detection rules that the fake malware is getting it's signatures from
