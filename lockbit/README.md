# LOCKBIT FAKE MALWARE

## Overview
This is a subset of the larger project to test and focus on one malware family, Lockbit. YARA rules for what detections are being used are still under the `/detection-rules/` directory. The configs in this repository under `iocloader/configs` is a YAML file containing the 

* Malicious strings of the binary AKA MalStrings
* Malicious byte sequences of the binary AKA MalBytes
* File paths that are created by the binary AKA MalPaths
* Commands the malware will attempt to execute AKA MalCommands
* Files created by the binary AKA MalFiles

These are all gathered from the YARA rules and made to be benign. 

## Building the Malicious Bytes
To include raw bytes/strings in the package be sure to first run `go generate` to ensure the `malbins/malbytes.bin` file is generated. This will be embedded into the main program. 

## Building the Executable
`env GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags "-s -w" -buildvcs=false fakelockbit_generator.go`

This will try to remove several of the debug symbols.
